# Calculator
This project is a basic calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a simple interface with buttons for numbers and arithmetic operators, along with a display area to show the input and results. JavaScript functions handle appending input to the display, clearing the display, and performing calculations.
